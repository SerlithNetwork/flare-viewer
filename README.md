### Supported Backends
Flare viewer was designed to work on pair with [Jet](https://github.com/SerlithNetwork/Jet). \
Since the Flare protocol expects a single endpoint for both submitting data and using the web-ui, it is
highly recommended to use a reverse proxy like Nginx to forward the requests accordingly.
